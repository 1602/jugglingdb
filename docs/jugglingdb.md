JugglingDB(3) - cross-database ORM for nodejs and the browser
=========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

JugglingDB is a cross-db ORM for nodejs, that provides a **common interface** to access
many popular database engines. JugglingDB Current supports: mysql, sqlite3,
postgres, couchdb, mongodb, redis, neo4j and in-memory-storage.

JugglingDB also works client-side (using WebService and Memory adapters),
which allows rich client-side apps to talk to application servers using a JSON API.


## INSTALLATION

Use npm to install the core package:

    npm install jugglingdb --save

Alternatively you can install the jugglingdb core from github:

    npm install 1602/jugglingdb

Then install an adapter for specific database, for example for redis `jugglingdb-redis`:

    npm install jugglingdb-redis

See [ADAPTERS][] for a list of available adapters.
