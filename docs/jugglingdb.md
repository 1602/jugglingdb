JugglingDB(3) - cross-database ORM for nodejs and browser
=========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

JugglingDB is a cross-db ORM for nodejs, providing **common interface** to access
most popular database formats.  Currently supported db formats are: mysql, sqlite3,
postgres, couchdb, mongodb, redis, neo4j and in-memory-storage.

JugglingDB also works on client-side (using WebService and Memory adapters),
which allow to write rich client-side apps talking to server using JSON API.

    npm install jugglingdb --save

Alternatively you can install jugglingdb core from github:

    npm install 1602/jugglingdb

Then install adapter for specific database, for example `jugglingdb-redis`:
