JugglingDB(3) - cross-database ORM for nodejs and browser
=========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

JugglingDB is cross-db ORM for nodejs, providing **common interface** to access
most popular database formats.  Currently supported are: mysql, sqlite3,
postgres, couchdb, mongodb, redis, neo4j and in-memory-storage.

JugglingDB also works on client-side (using WebService and Memory adapters),
which allows to write rich client-side apps talking to server using JSON API.
